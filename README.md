Linky
=====

Linky initially started out as an app that contained pre-defined text messages so that users could keep in touch with their significant others quickly and easily. The prime example use of Linky is when out with friends; when out at a bar, it's rude to pull out the phone and start typing. With this app, only one quick tap is necessary to send a message to a pre-defined significant other. 

The app now includes pre-defined text messages, "level" sliders that will send a "level 1-10" text message, Instapics which capture and send an MMS one with tap, and Buzzes which cause the other linked phone to vibrate and display a simple toast message.

Linky has also since been updated to include an SMS forwarding feature. When installed and a forwarding number is set, the app will forward any incoming text messages to the forwarding number. If the app is also installed on the receiving phone, the app will parse the forwarded text message and insert it into the local Android SMS database as if it were a true text message coming from the originating number. This should probably be moved out into it's own app at a later time.

Work in progress.
